<p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;">We have introduced a subversive new bench-top, a very cost-effective machine to pack teas, herbal powders, yerba dust mate, oolong tea, granulate coffee beans which can be packed in pre-made filter tea bags with or without string &amp; tag, also with or without the outer envelopes. The counter-top equipment enables you to calculate the product material weight and swiftly measure the quantity weight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;">We can fill the tea bags and sachet without spilling the filling materials and then seal the pouch/sachets instantly. In this way, the machinery helps customers to fill and seal from a few tea bags/sachets to a few hundred of tea bags in just a few minutes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;">The SIKRI Filler Sealer is a single operator run machine that requires an operator to fill the tea bags and then seal it. Then the operator drops the tea into the tea bags with the help of a foot switch which is attached to the machine, thus it keeps both the hands free of the operator enabling faster production.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;">We provide Pre-made tea bags in different sizes along with this machine for filling different infusion items of teas and powder and also Pre-made Plain paper and PE/ foil laminates for packing food/ dipping products. This machine is also available 4 set series of volumetric cups with different opening diameters of 15 mm, 20mm, 25mm, and 30mm that comes along this machine. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;">Depending on the material type and quantity of tea, an operator can change the cup themselves. This process is very convenient and takes only about 2 minutes to change cups as per requirements. The adjustments can be done manually and it does not require any special tools for it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;">The SIKRI Filler sealer is the optimal ENTRY LEVEL DEVICE for small industries and in-home business of tea bag production. </span></p>
